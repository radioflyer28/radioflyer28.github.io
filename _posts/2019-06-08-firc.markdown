## Ch3 - Flight Reviews

**Sample Flight Review Checklist**  
AC-61-98D - Appendix E  
<https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_61-98D.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A108%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C720%2C0%5D>

**Sample Manuever Checklist**  
AC-61-98D - Appendix D  
<https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC_61-98D.pdf#%5B%7B%22num%22%3A108%2C%22gen%22%3A0%7D%2C%7B%22name%22%3A%22XYZ%22%7D%2C70%2C720%2C0%5D>

**Recommended List of Minimum Manuevers**  

- Takeoffs
- Stabilized approaches to landing
- Slow flight
- Stall recognition, stalls, and stall recovery
- Spin recognition and avoidance
- Recovery from unusual attitudes
- Operating the aircraft solely by reference to instruments (conducted in either actual or simulated IMC)

Advisory Circular (AC) 61-98, Currency Requirements and Guidance for the Flight Review and Instrument Proficiency Check, makes the important connection between the lack of proficiency and LOC.
“Studies have shown that LOC usually occurs when pilots lack proficiency. Conditions exceeding personal skill limitations can present themselves at any time. In this event, the pilot should be able to exercise skills at a proficiency level he or she may not have maintained or attained since initial training.” (Page 5, Para 2-1.b)

You can actively seek to reduce LOC incidents by making LOC prevention a central theme in your flight reviews. During the flight review, point out the five areas of interest outlined in the AC and monitor the pilot's proficiency in each of those areas. Here is a list of the five critical areas impacting GA safety as outlined in AC 61-98:

1. Loss of Control. Pilots must know how to avoid potential LOC situations. If one such situation is encountered, they must be able to recognize it and know how to recover from it.
2. Pilot Proficiency. LOC occurs most in pilots who are not proficient. Work out a personal currency program or provide a system for proficiency retention for each pilot you review. By focusing on the individual's proficiency needs, you will likely find it necessary to exceed the minimum currency requirements. That is okay! The General Aviation Joint Steering Committee (GAJSC) recommends taking such an approach to ensure each pilot receives the highest level of attention and instruction.
3. Traffic Pattern Operations. Focus your students on the three areas of LOC risk in the traffic pattern: (1) the potential for a departure stall, (2) the danger in an attempt to return to the field following an engine failure on take off, and (3) the risk of LOC in the base turn to final.
4. Criteria for Stabilized Approaches. Review the criteria for a stabilized approach and monitor approach parameters in flight. Provide instruction as required to help pilots improve their instrument crosscheck and workload management.
5. Instrument Meteorological Conditions (IMC). Flight into IMC can be disorienting, especially to those not appropriately rated or proficient to do so. Spatial disorientation in IMC often leads to LOC. Proper prioritization of pilot workload is required to ensure the pilot does not become distracted or lose situational awareness. Emphasize good Crew Resource Management (CRM) or Single-Pilot Resource Management (SRM), as discussed in Lesson 1 of this course, to the pilots for whom you are performing the flight review or IPC. Remind pilots that just because they can fly into IMC does not mean they should. Proficiency must always be considered before placing oneself in a situation that can potentially induce spatial disorientation and subsequent LOC.
